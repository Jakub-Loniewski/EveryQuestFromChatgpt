#Quest
#Write a Python program that prompts the user for two numbers
#And then displays the result of basic mathematical operations on those numbers
#addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

print("Hello in 4 simply mathematic operations")

Number1 = float(input("enter the first number: "))
Number2 = float(input("enter the second number: "))

#I did the addition
Addition = (Number1 + Number2)
print(f"I did the addition and the result is: {Addition}")

#I did the subtraction

Subtraction = (Number1 - Number2)
print(f"I did subtraction the result is: {Subtraction}")

#I did the multiplication

Multiplication = (Number1*Number2)
print(f"I did Multiply the result is: {Multiplication}")

#I did the division

Division = (Number1 / Number2)
print(f"I did dividing the result is: {Division}")

print("End of Program")
